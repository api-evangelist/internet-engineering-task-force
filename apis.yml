  The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is an open, global community of
  network designers, engineers, researchers, and operators that develops and
  promotes voluntary technical standards to ensure the smooth operation and
  evolution of the internet. Its work is carried out through working groups
  organized by technical areas such as routing, security, transport, and
  applications, with a focus on producing practical, consensus-driven standards
  like the TCP/IP protocols, HTTP, and email formats. The IETF operates in a
  highly collaborative and transparent wayanyone can participateand its
  standards are published as freely accessible RFCs (Requests for Comments),
  which serve as the foundation for the internets interoperability and
  scalability.
